# Example Project Routing Configuration
# This file shows how project-specific routing is generated
# Real files are created dynamically in /etc/supapanel/traefik/dynamic/

# http:
#   routers:
#     myproject-api:
#       rule: "Host(`myproject.example.com`)"
#       entryPoints:
#         - websecure
#       service: myproject-api
#       tls:
#         certResolver: letsencrypt
#
#     myproject-studio:
#       rule: "Host(`studio.myproject.example.com`)"
#       entryPoints:
#         - websecure
#       service: myproject-studio
#       tls:
#         certResolver: letsencrypt
#
#   services:
#     myproject-api:
#       loadBalancer:
#         servers:
#           - url: "http://myproject-kong:8000"
